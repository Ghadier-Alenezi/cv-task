      <p>
        For the past 4 years i've been interested in programming and computer
        science so I sign up with 1 Million Arab Coders in 2017 but my computer
        was so old so it crashed from the first month, I decided to start
        learning this year with tuwaiq bootcamp and here I'm coding everyday.
